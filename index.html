                <h2>What is a Halo?</h2>
                <p>A halo is a crown of light rays, circle or disk of light that surrounds a person in works of art. The halo occurs in the iconography of many religions to indicate holy or sacred figures.</p>

                <h2>Does the Bible mention halos</h2>
                <p>The Bible does not directly speak of halos as observed in religious art. The closest expressions are found in examples of Jesus in Revelation described in glorious light (Revelation 1) [...] Moses had a face that shone with light after being in the presence of God (Exodus 34:29-35). However, in none of these cases is the light involved described as a halo.</p>
