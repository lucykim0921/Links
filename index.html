                <h2>What is a Halo?</h2>
                <p>A halo is a crown of light rays, circle or disk of light that surrounds a person in works of art. The halo occurs in the iconography of many religions to indicate holy or sacred figures.</p>

                <h2>Does the Bible mention halos?</h2>
                <p>The Bible does not directly speak of halos as observed in religious art. The closest expressions are found in examples of Jesus in Revelation described in glorious light (Revelation 1) [...] Moses had a face that shone with light after being in the presence of God (Exodus 34:29&ndash;35). However, in none of these cases is the light involved described as a halo.</p>

                <h2>Byzantine Art as Propaganda</h2>
                <p>"Power on earth was once &ndash; and sometimes even now &ndash; perceived as a result of power in heaven. The great double mosaic of Justinian and Theodora at San Vitale in Ravenna is a forceful exercise in demonstrating power through art as propaganda, fusing political and religious imagery for a double statement of authority. In the 6th century, many intellectual Christians, not necessarily an oxymoron despite the possibility thereof, would have found these mosaics hubristic. Even the cynical could have found these mosaics troubling. Yet there are at least three possible reasons why this propaganda was justifiable for a Byzantine ruler. The mosaics here are perhaps the greatest of early Byzantine if not all post&ndash;Roman mosaics; they do serve as embellishment to reinforce the grandeur of Justinian, perhaps simultaneously last Roman emperor and first Byzantine emperor."</p>
